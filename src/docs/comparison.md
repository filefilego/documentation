# Comparison

In this section, we cover the disadvantages of different protocols and file-sharing methods and examine their weaknesses.

## XDCC

XDCC (Xabi DCC or eXtended DCC) is a computer file sharing method which uses the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) network as a host service.

| x | XDCC Disadvantages |
|---|--------------------|
| :red_circle:  | Requires a centralized indexer/tracker/lister which is subject to censorship and single point of failure |
|  :red_circle: | Transfer protocol rather than a complete file sharing solution |
|  :red_circle: | No built-in search functionality |
|  :red_circle: | No incentive to retain data |
## Usenet

Usenet is a distributed discussion system since 1980.


| x | Usenet Disadvantages |
|---|--------------------|
| :red_circle:  | Requires a centralized indexer/tracker/lister which is subject to censorship and single point of failure |
|  :red_circle: | Most of the time requires subscription and forces user to pay - what if only one single file is needed? |
|  :red_circle: | Although Usenet providers retain data, it still lacks the incentive mechanism which allows other peers to participate in the retention process |
|  :red_circle: | Usenet servers do not operate in a peer-to-peer model and most operators just have a cluster of servers which are owned by them |


## BitTorrent

BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol that requires a client and trackers/DHT.


| x | BitTorrent Disadvantages |
|---|--------------------|
| :red_circle:  | Requires a centralized indexer/tracker/lister which is subject to censorship and single point of failure |
|  :red_circle: | Inactive Torrents without seeders/Lack of incentive mechanism to reward peers for seeding |
|  :red_circle: | IP addresses are completely exposed. Anyone can see what user is downloading and uploading |
|  :red_circle: | (Optional) Requires additional VPN and proxy services which are paid services, to solve the above problem |
|  :red_circle: | Unstable download/upload speed |



## Cyberlocker / Filehoster

A cyberlocker is a third-party online service that provides file-storing and file-sharing services.


| x | Cyberlocker / Filehoster Disadvantages |
|---|--------------------|
| :red_circle:  | Requires a centralized indexer/tracker/lister which is subject to censorship and single point of failure |
|  :red_circle: |The Filehoster on its own is subject to censorship. (e.g megaupload was shut down by DOJ) |
|  :red_circle: | IRequires subscription and premium upgrades - what if only one single file is needed?  |
|  :red_circle: | Extremely slow speeds which force users to pay for premium account|
|  :red_circle: | Inactive files are deleted after a few months / Lack of incentive mechanism |
|  :red_circle: | Your personal information and credit card data are in risk of being abused or sold since most operators disappear |
