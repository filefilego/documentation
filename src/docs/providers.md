# Introduction

Filefilego utilizes the storage engine to store off-chain data in a distributed network of peers. This approach enables anyone to operate a storage provider peer by running a full node with the Storage options and making the endpoint available to other applications in need of storage. By implementing this design, decentralized applications can store files on the network without the need for full-nodes or powerful devices.

# Benefits of Running a Storage Provider Node

Storage providers offer their hard disk space either to their respective applications or to the general public. These storage nodes are able to establish the fees charged for serving each Byte of data to other nodes, which typically includes the costs of bandwidth and storage retention. This system generates economic incentives for participation in the storage network, ultimately leading to an increase in the network's storage capacity.
