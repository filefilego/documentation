# Introduction

In filefilego, off-chain data is stored across a distributed network of peers using the `Binlayer storage engine`. Anyone can run a storage provider peer by running a full node with the binlayer options and make the endpoint available to other applications that require storage. With this design, its possible for dapps to store files on the network without running full-nodes or any powerful device.

# Benefits of Running a Storage Provider Node

Storage providers offer their hard disk space to either their applications or to the public. These storage nodes can set the fees they charge for serving each GB of data to other nodes which usually includes the bandwidth and the storage costs of retention. This creates the economic incentives to participate in the storage network which in turn increases the storage capacity of the network.
