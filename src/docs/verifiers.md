# Introduction

The network relies on a group of validators known as "Data Verifiers" to verify data transfers between nodes, as detailed in the "Consensus" section. These verifiers employ the PoX/PoDP algorithms, which utilize CPU-intensive symmetric encryption and hash functions.

# Benefits of Running a Data Verification Node

By running a Data Verification Node, users have the opportunity to earn verification fees while supporting and securing the network ecosystem. These fees are not fixed and are dynamically calculated based on the verification workload performed on the network.

The verification process resembles mining, but instead of mining blocks, data signatures are compared and validated.
