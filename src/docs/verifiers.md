# Introduction

Data transfers between nodes in the network are verified by a set of validators called `Data Verifiers` as discussed in the [Consensus](./consensus.md) section. Data verifiers run the PoX/PoDP algorithms which utilize symmetric encryption and hash functions that are highly CPU-bound.

# Benefits of Running a Data Verification Node

Running a Data Verification Node allows you to get rewarded with a verification fee while supporting and securing the network/ecosystem. The reward fee is not fixed and is dynamically calculated for each verification performed on the network.

This verification process is similar to mining but instead of mining blocks, data signatures are compared and validated.
